@c  Note the @ref above must be on one line, a line break in an @ref within
@c  @copying will bomb in recent texinfo.tex (eg. 2004-04-07.08 which comes
@c  with texinfo 4.7), with messages about missing @endcsname.


@c  Texinfo version 4.2 or up will be needed to process this file.
@c
@c  The version number and edition number are taken from version.texi provided
@c  by automake (note that it's regenerated only if you configure with
@c  --enable-maintainer-mode).
@c
@c  Notes discussing the present version number of GMP in relation to previous
@c  ones (for instance in the "Compatibility" section) must be updated at
@c  manually though.
@c
@c  @cindex entries have been made for function categories and programming
@c  topics.  The "mpn" section is not included in this, because a beginner
@c  looking for "GCD" or something is only going to be confused by pointers to
@c  low level routines.
@c
@c  @cindex entries are present for processors and systems when there's
@c  particular notes concerning them, but not just for everything GMP
@c  supports.
@c
@c  Index entries for files use @code rather than @file, @samp or @option,
@c  since the latter come out with quotes in TeX, which are nice in the text
@c  but don't look so good in index columns.

@c  may want to search-and-replace to some online source.

@c  @m{T,N} is $T$ in tex or @math{N} otherwise.  This is an easy way to give
@c  different forms for math in tex and info.  Commas in N or T don't work,
@c  but @C{} can be used instead.  \, works in info but not in tex.
@iftex
@macro m {T,N}
@tex$\T\$@end tex
@end macro
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@macro m {T,N}
@math{\N\}
@end macro
@end ifnottex

@macro C {}

@c  @ms{V,N} is $V_N$ in tex or just vn otherwise.  This suits simple
@c  subscripts like @ms{x,0}.
@iftex

@end macro
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@macro ms {V,N}
\V\\N\
@end macro

@c  @nicode{S} is plain S in info, or @code{S} elsewhere.  This can be used
@c  when the quotes that @code{} gives in info aren't wanted, but the
@c  fontification in tex or html is wanted.  Doesn't work as @nicode{'\\0'}
@c  though (gives two backslashes in tex).

@c  Usage: @W{text}
@c  Like @w{} but working in math mode too.
@tex
\gdef\W#1{\ifmmode{#1}\else\w{#1}\fi}
@end tex
@ifnottex
@macro W {S}
@w{\S\}
@end macro
@end ifnottex

@c  Usage: \GMPdisplay{text}
@c  Put the given text in an @display style indent, but without turning off
@c  paragraph reflow etc.
@tex
\gdef\GMPdisplay#1{%
\noindent
\advance\leftskip by \lispnarrowing
#1\par}

@c  Usage: \GMPhat
@c  A new \hat that will work in math mode, unlike the texinfo redefined
@c  version.
@tex
\gdef\GMPhat{\mathaccent"705E}
@end tex

@c  Usage: \GMPraise{text}
@c  For use in a $ $ math expression as an alternative to "^".  This is good
@c  for @code{} in an exponent, since there seems to be no superscript font
@c  for that.
@tex
\gdef\GMPraise#1{\mskip0.5\thinmuskip\hbox{\raise0.8ex\hbox{#1}}}

@iftex
@macro texlinebreak
@*
@end macro
@end iftex
@ifnottex
@macro texlinebreak
@end macro
@end ifnottex

@c  Usage: @maybepagebreak
@c  Allow tex to insert a page break, if it feels the urge.
@c  Normally blocks of @deftypefun/funx are kept together, which can lead to
@c  some poor page break positioning if it's a big block, like the sets of
@c  division functions etc.
@tex
\gdef\maybepagebreak{\penalty0}
@end tex
@ifnottex
@macro maybepagebreak
@end macro
@end ifnottex

@c  Usage: @GMPreftop{info,title}
@c  Usage: @GMPpxreftop{info,title}
@c
@c  Like @ref{} and @pxref{}, but designed for a reference to the top of a
@c  document, not a particular section.  The TeX output for plain @ref insists
@c  on printing a particular section, GMPreftop gives just the title.
@c
@c  The texinfo manual recommends putting a likely section name in references
@c  like this, eg. "Introduction", but it seems better to just give the title.
@c
@iftex
@macro GMPreftop{info,title}
@i{\title\}
@end macro
@macro GMPpxreftop{info,title}
see @i{\title\}
@end macro

@cindex License conditions

This library is @dfn{free}; this means that everyone is free to use it and
free to redistribute it on a free basis.  The library is not in the public
domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its distribution, but
these restrictions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating
citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent others
from further sharing any version of this library that they might get from
you.@refill

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies
of the library, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want
it, that you can change this library or use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you know you can do these things.@refill

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive
anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies of the GNU
MP library, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you
must tell them their rights.@refill

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for the GNU MP library.  If it is modified by
someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know that what they
have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced by others
will not reflect on our reputation.@refill

More precisely, the GNU MP library is dual licensed, under the conditions of
the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (see
@file{COPYING.LESSERv3}), or the GNU General Public License version 2 (see
@file{COPYINGv2}). This is the recipient's choice, and the recipient also has
the additional option of applying later versions of these licenses. (The
reason for this dual licensing is to make it possible to use the library with
programs which are licensed under GPL version 2, but which for historical or
other reasons do not allow use under later versions of the GPL).

Programs which are not part of the library itself, such as demonstration
programs and the GMP testsuite, are licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License version 3 (see @file{COPYINGv3}), or any later

@chapter Introduction to GNU MP
@cindex Introduction

GNU MP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic
on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  It aims to provide
the fastest possible arithmetic for all applications that need higher
precision than is directly supported by the basic C types.

Many applications use just a few hundred bits of precision; but some
applications may need thousands or even millions of bits.  GMP is designed to
give good performance for both, by choosing algorithms based on the sizes of
the operands, and by carefully keeping the overhead at a minimum.

The speed of GMP is achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic type,
by using sophisticated algorithms, by including carefully optimized assembly
code for the most common inner loops for many different CPUs, and by a general
emphasis on speed (as opposed to simplicity or elegance).

There is assembly code for these CPUs:
@cindex CPU types
ARM Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, and generic ARM,
DEC Alpha 21064, 21164, and 21264,
AMD K8 and K10 (sold under many brands, e.g. Athlon64, Phenom, Opteron)
Bulldozer, and Bobcat,
Intel Pentium, Pentium Pro/II/III, Pentium 4, Core2, Nehalem, Sandy bridge, Haswell, generic x86,
Intel IA-64,
Motorola/IBM PowerPC 32 and 64 such as POWER970, POWER5, POWER6, and POWER7,
MIPS 32-bit and 64-bit,
SPARC 32-bit ad 64-bit with special support for all UltraSPARC models.
There is also assembly code for many obsolete CPUs.

@cindex About this manual

Everyone should read @ref{GMP Basics}.  If you need to install the library
yourself, then read @ref{Installing GMP}.  If you have a system with multiple
ABIs, then read @ref{ABI and ISA}, for the compiler options that must be used
on applications.

The rest of the manual can be used for later reference, although it is
probably a good idea to glance through it.

@chapter Installing GMP
@cindex Installing GMP
@cindex Configuring GMP
@cindex Building GMP

GMP has an autoconf/automake/libtool based configuration system.  On a
Unix-like system a basic build can be done with

@example
./configure
make
@end example

@noindent
Some self-tests can be run with

@example
make check
@end example

@noindent
And you can install (under @file{/usr/local} by default) with

@example
make install
@end example

If you experience problems, please report them to @email{gmp-bugs@@gmplib.org}.
See @ref{Reporting Bugs}, for information on what to include in useful bug
reports.

@node Build Options, ABI and ISA, Installing GMP, Installing GMP
@section Build Options
@cindex Build options

All the usual autoconf configure options are available, run @samp{./configure
--help} for a summary.  The file @file{INSTALL.autoconf} has some generic
installation information too.

@table @asis
@item Tools
@cindex Non-Unix systems
@samp{configure} requires various Unix-like tools.  See @ref{Notes for
Particular Systems}, for some options on non-Unix systems.

It might be possible to build without the help of @samp{configure}, certainly
all the code is there, but unfortunately you'll be on your own.

@item Build Directory
@cindex Build directory
To compile in a separate build directory, @command{cd} to that directory, and
prefix the configure command with the path to the GMP source directory.  For
example

@example
cd /my/build/dir
/my/sources/gmp-@value{VERSION}/configure
@end example

Not all @samp{make} programs have the necessary features (@code{VPATH}) to
support this.  In particular, SunOS and Slowaris @command{make} have bugs that
make them unable to build in a separate directory.  Use GNU @command{make}
instead.

@item @option{--prefix} and @option{--exec-prefix}
@cindex Prefix
@cindex Exec prefix
@cindex Install prefix
@cindex @code{--prefix}
@cindex @code{--exec-prefix}
The @option{--prefix} option can be used in the normal way to direct GMP to
install under a particular tree.  The default is @samp{/usr/local}.

@option{--exec-prefix} can be used to direct architecture-dependent files like
@file{libgmp.a} to a different location.  This can be used to share
architecture-independent parts like the documentation, but separate the
dependent parts.  Note however that @file{gmp.h} and @file{mp.h} are
architecture-dependent since they encode certain aspects of @file{libgmp}, so
it will be necessary to ensure both @file{$prefix/include} and
@file{$exec_prefix/include} are available to the compiler.

@item @option{--disable-shared}, @option{--disable-static}
@cindex @code{--disable-shared}
@cindex @code{--disable-static}
By default both shared and static libraries are built (where possible), but
one or other can be disabled.  Shared libraries result in smaller executables
and permit code sharing between separate running processes, but on some CPUs
are slightly slower, having a small cost on each function call.

@item Native Compilation, @option{--build=CPU-VENDOR-OS}
@cindex Native compilation
@cindex Build system
@cindex @code{--build}
For normal native compilation, the system can be specified with
@samp{--build}.  By default @samp{./configure} uses the output from running
@samp{./config.guess}.  On some systems @samp{./config.guess} can determine
the exact CPU type, on others it will be necessary to give it explicitly.  For
example,

@example
./configure --build=ultrasparc-sun-solaris2.7
@end example

In all cases the @samp{OS} part is important, since it controls how libtool
generates shared libraries.  Running @samp{./config.guess} is the simplest way
to see what it should be, if you don't know already.

@item Cross Compilation, @option{--host=CPU-VENDOR-OS}
@cindex Cross compiling
@cindex Host system
@cindex @code{--host}
When cross-compiling, the system used for compiling is given by @samp{--build}
and the system where the library will run is given by @samp{--host}.  For
example when using a FreeBSD Athlon system to build GNU/Linux m68k binaries,

@example
./configure --build=athlon-pc-freebsd3.5 --host=m68k-mac-linux-gnu
@end example

Compiler tools are sought first with the host system type as a prefix.  For
example @command{m68k-mac-linux-gnu-ranlib} is tried, then plain
@command{ranlib}.  This makes it possible for a set of cross-compiling tools
to co-exist with native tools.  The prefix is the argument to @samp{--host},
and this can be an alias, such as @samp{m68k-linux}.  But note that tools
don't have to be setup this way, it's enough to just have a @env{PATH} with a
suitable cross-compiling @command{cc} etc.

Compiling for a different CPU in the same family as the build system is a form
of cross-compilation, though very possibly this would merely be special
options on a native compiler.  In any case @samp{./configure} avoids depending
on being able to run code on the build system, which is important when
creating binaries for a newer CPU since they very possibly won't run on the
build system.

In all cases the compiler must be able to produce an executable (of whatever
format) from a standard C @code{main}.  Although only object files will go to
make up @file{libgmp}, @samp{./configure} uses linking tests for various
purposes, such as determining what functions are available on the host system.

Currently a warning is given unless an explicit @samp{--build} is used when
cross-compiling, because it may not be possible to correctly guess the build
system type if the @env{PATH} has only a cross-compiling @command{cc}.

Note that the @samp{--target} option is not appropriate for GMP@.  It's for use
when building compiler tools, with @samp{--host} being where they will run,
and @samp{--target} what they'll produce code for.  Ordinary programs or
libraries like GMP are only interested in the @samp{--host} part, being where
they'll run.  (Some past versions of GMP used @samp{--target} incorrectly.)

@item CPU types
@cindex CPU types
In general, if you want a library that runs as fast as possible, you should
configure GMP for the exact CPU type your system uses.  However, this may mean
the binaries won't run on older members of the family, and might run slower on
other members, older or newer.  The best idea is always to build GMP for the
exact machine type you intend to run it on.

The following CPUs have specific support.  See @file{configure.ac} for details
of what code and compiler options they select.

CPUs not listed will use generic C code.

@item Generic C Build
@cindex Generic C
If some of the assembly code causes problems, or if otherwise desired, the
generic C code can be selected with the configure @option{--disable-assembly}.

Note that this will run quite slowly, but it should be portable and should at
least make it possible to get something running if all else fails.

@item Fat binary, @option{--enable-fat}
@cindex Fat binary
@cindex @code{--enable-fat}
Using @option{--enable-fat} selects a ``fat binary'' build on x86, where
optimized low level subroutines are chosen at runtime according to the CPU
detected.  This means more code, but gives good performance on all x86 chips.
(This option might become available for more architectures in the future.)

@item @option{ABI}
@cindex ABI
On some systems GMP supports multiple ABIs (application binary interfaces),
meaning data type sizes and calling conventions.  By default GMP chooses the
best ABI available, but a particular ABI can be selected.  For example

@example
./configure --host=mips64-sgi-irix6 ABI=n32
@end example

See @ref{ABI and ISA}, for the available choices on relevant CPUs, and what
applications need to do.

@item @option{CC}, @option{CFLAGS}
@cindex C compiler
@cindex @code{CC}
@cindex @code{CFLAGS}
By default the C compiler used is chosen from among some likely candidates,
with @command{gcc} normally preferred if it's present.  The usual
@samp{CC=whatever} can be passed to @samp{./configure} to choose something
different.

For various systems, default compiler flags are set based on the CPU and
compiler.  The usual @samp{CFLAGS="-whatever"} can be passed to
@samp{./configure} to use something different or to set good flags for systems
GMP doesn't otherwise know.

The @samp{CC} and @samp{CFLAGS} used are printed during @samp{./configure},
and can be found in each generated @file{Makefile}.  This is the easiest way
to check the defaults when considering changing or adding something.

Note that when @samp{CC} and @samp{CFLAGS} are specified on a system
supporting multiple ABIs it's important to give an explicit
@samp{ABI=whatever}, since GMP can't determine the ABI just from the flags and
won't be able to select the correct assembly code.

If just @samp{CC} is selected then normal default @samp{CFLAGS} for that
compiler will be used (if GMP recognises it).  For example @samp{CC=gcc} can
be used to force the use of GCC, with default flags (and default ABI).

@item @option{CPPFLAGS}
@cindex @code{CPPFLAGS}
Any flags like @samp{-D} defines or @samp{-I} includes required by the
preprocessor should be set in @samp{CPPFLAGS} rather than @samp{CFLAGS}.
Compiling is done with both @samp{CPPFLAGS} and @samp{CFLAGS}, but
preprocessing uses just @samp{CPPFLAGS}.  This distinction is because most
preprocessors won't accept all the flags the compiler does.  Preprocessing is
done separately in some configure tests.

@item @option{CC_FOR_BUILD}
@cindex @code{CC_FOR_BUILD}
Some build-time programs are compiled and run to generate host-specific data
tables.  @samp{CC_FOR_BUILD} is the compiler used for this.  It doesn't need
to be in any particular ABI or mode, it merely needs to generate executables
that can run.  The default is to try the selected @samp{CC} and some likely
candidates such as @samp{cc} and @samp{gcc}, looking for something that works.

No flags are used with @samp{CC_FOR_BUILD} because a simple invocation like
@samp{cc foo.c} should be enough.  If some particular options are required
they can be included as for instance @samp{CC_FOR_BUILD="cc -whatever"}.

@item C++ Support, @option{--enable-cxx}
@cindex C++ support
@cindex @code{--enable-cxx}
C++ support in GMP can be enabled with @samp{--enable-cxx}, in which case a
C++ compiler will be required.  As a convenience @samp{--enable-cxx=detect}
can be used to enable C++ support only if a compiler can be found.  The C++
support consists of a library @file{libgmpxx.la} and header file
@file{gmpxx.h} (@pxref{Headers and Libraries}).

A separate @file{libgmpxx.la} has been adopted rather than having C++ objects
within @file{libgmp.la} in order to ensure dynamic linked C programs aren't
bloated by a dependency on the C++ standard library, and to avoid any chance
that the C++ compiler could be required when linking plain C programs.

@file{libgmpxx.la} will use certain internals from @file{libgmp.la} and can
only be expected to work with @file{libgmp.la} from the same GMP version.
Future changes to the relevant internals will be accompanied by renaming, so a
mismatch will cause unresolved symbols rather than perhaps mysterious
misbehaviour.

In general @file{libgmpxx.la} will be usable only with the C++ compiler that
built it, since name mangling and runtime support are usually incompatible
between different compilers.

@item @option{CXX}, @option{CXXFLAGS}
@cindex C++ compiler
@cindex @code{CXX}
@cindex @code{CXXFLAGS}
When C++ support is enabled, the C++ compiler and its flags can be set with
variables @samp{CXX} and @samp{CXXFLAGS} in the usual way.  The default for
@samp{CXX} is the first compiler that works from a list of likely candidates,
with @command{g++} normally preferred when available.  The default for
@samp{CXXFLAGS} is to try @samp{CFLAGS}, @samp{CFLAGS} without @samp{-g}, then
for @command{g++} either @samp{-g -O2} or @samp{-O2}, or for other compilers
@samp{-g} or nothing.  Trying @samp{CFLAGS} this way is convenient when using
@samp{gcc} and @samp{g++} together, since the flags for @samp{gcc} will
usually suit @samp{g++}.

It's important that the C and C++ compilers match, meaning their startup and
runtime support routines are compatible and that they generate code in the
same ABI (if there's a choice of ABIs on the system).  @samp{./configure}
isn't currently able to check these things very well itself, so for that
reason @samp{--disable-cxx} is the default, to avoid a build failure due to a
compiler mismatch.  Perhaps this will change in the future.

Incidentally, it's normally not good enough to set @samp{CXX} to the same as
@samp{CC}.  Although @command{gcc} for instance recognises @file{foo.cc} as
C++ code, only @command{g++} will invoke the linker the right way when
building an executable or shared library from C++ object files.

@item Temporary Memory, @option{--enable-alloca=<choice>}
@cindex Temporary memory
@cindex Stack overflow
@cindex @code{alloca}
@cindex @code{--enable-alloca}
GMP allocates temporary workspace using one of the following three methods,
which can be selected with for instance
@samp{--enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{alloca} - C library or compiler builtin.
@item
@samp{malloc-reentrant} - the heap, in a re-entrant fashion.
@item
@samp{malloc-notreentrant} - the heap, with global variables.
@end itemize

For convenience, the following choices are also available.
@samp{--disable-alloca} is the same as @samp{no}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@samp{yes} - a synonym for @samp{alloca}.
@item
@samp{no} - a synonym for @samp{malloc-reentrant}.
@item
@samp{reentrant} - @code{alloca} if available, otherwise
@samp{malloc-reentrant}.  This is the default.
@item
@samp{notreentrant} - @code{alloca} if available, otherwise
@samp{malloc-notreentrant}.
@end itemize

@code{alloca} is reentrant and fast, and is recommended.  It actually allocates
just small blocks on the stack; larger ones use malloc-reentrant.

@samp{malloc-reentrant} is, as the name suggests, reentrant and thread safe,
but @samp{malloc-notreentrant} is faster and should be used if reentrancy is
not required.

The two malloc methods in fact use the memory allocation functions selected by
@code{mp_set_memory_functions}, these being @code{malloc} and friends by
default.  @xref{Custom Allocation}.

An additional choice @samp{--enable-alloca=debug} is available, to help when
debugging memory related problems (@pxref{Debugging}).

@item FFT Multiplication, @option{--disable-fft}
@cindex FFT multiplication
@cindex @code{--disable-fft}
By default multiplications are done using Karatsuba, 3-way Toom, higher degree
Toom, and Fermat FFT@.  The FFT is only used on large to very large operands
and can be disabled to save code size if desired.

@item Assertion Checking, @option{--enable-assert}
@cindex Assertion checking
@cindex @code{--enable-assert}
This option enables some consistency checking within the library.  This can be
of use while debugging, @pxref{Debugging}.

@item Execution Profiling, @option{--enable-profiling=prof/gprof/instrument}
@cindex Execution profiling
@cindex @code{--enable-profiling}
Enable profiling support, in one of various styles, @pxref{Profiling}.

@item @option{MPN_PATH}
@cindex @code{MPN_PATH}
Various assembly versions of each mpn subroutines are provided.  For a given
CPU, a search is made though a path to choose a version of each.  For example
@samp{sparcv8} has

@example
MPN_PATH="sparc32/v8 sparc32 generic"
@end example

which means look first for v8 code, then plain sparc32 (which is v7), and
finally fall back on generic C@.  Knowledgeable users with special requirements
can specify a different path.  Normally this is completely unnecessary.

@item Documentation

@node ABI and ISA, Notes for Package Builds, Build Options, Installing GMP
@section ABI and ISA
@cindex ABI
@cindex Application Binary Interface
@cindex ISA
@cindex Instruction Set Architecture

ABI (Application Binary Interface) refers to the calling conventions between
functions, meaning what registers are used and what sizes the various C data
types are.  ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) refers to the instructions and
registers a CPU has available.

Some 64-bit ISA CPUs have both a 64-bit ABI and a 32-bit ABI defined, the
latter for compatibility with older CPUs in the family.  GMP supports some
CPUs like this in both ABIs.  In fact within GMP @samp{ABI} means a
combination of chip ABI, plus how GMP chooses to use it.  For example in some
32-bit ABIs, GMP may support a limb as either a 32-bit @code{long} or a 64-bit
@code{long long}.

By default GMP chooses the best ABI available for a given system, and this
generally gives significantly greater speed.  But an ABI can be chosen
explicitly to make GMP compatible with other libraries, or particular
application requirements.  For example,

@example
./configure ABI=32
@end example

In all cases it's vital that all object code used in a given program is
compiled for the same ABI.

Usually a limb is implemented as a @code{long}.  When a @code{long long} limb
is used this is encoded in the generated @file{gmp.h}.  This is convenient for
applications, but it does mean that @file{gmp.h} will vary, and can't be just
copied around.  @file{gmp.h} remains compiler independent though, since all
compilers for a particular ABI will be expected to use the same limb type.

Currently no attempt is made to follow whatever conventions a system has for
installing library or header files built for a particular ABI@.  This will
probably only matter when installing multiple builds of GMP, and it might be
as simple as configuring with a special @samp{libdir}, or it might require
more than that.  Note that builds for different ABIs need to done separately,
with a fresh @command{./configure} and @command{make} each.

@cindex AMD64
On AMD64 systems supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit modes for applications, the
following ABI choices are available.

@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=64}
The 64-bit ABI uses 64-bit limbs and pointers and makes full use of the chip
architecture.  This is the default.  Applications will usually not need
special compiler flags, but for reference the option is

@example
gcc  -m64
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=32}
The 32-bit ABI is the usual i386 conventions.  This will be slower, and is not
recommended except for inter-operating with other code not yet 64-bit capable.
Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc  -m32
@end example

(In GCC 2.95 and earlier there's no @samp{-m32} option, it's the only mode.)

@item @samp{ABI=x32}
The x32 ABI uses 64-bit limbs but 32-bit pointers.  Like the 64-bit ABI, it
makes full use of the chip's arithmetic capabilities.  This ABI is not
supported by all operating systems.

@example
gcc  -mx32
@end example

@end table

@item HPPA 2.0 (@samp{hppa2.0*}, @samp{hppa64})
@cindex HPPA
@cindex HP-UX
@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=2.0w}
The 2.0w ABI uses 64-bit limbs and pointers and is available on HP-UX 11 or
up.  Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc [built for 2.0w]
cc  +DD64
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=2.0n}
The 2.0n ABI means the 32-bit HPPA 1.0 ABI and all its normal calling
conventions, but with 64-bit instructions permitted within functions.  GMP
uses a 64-bit @code{long long} for a limb.  This ABI is available on hppa64
GNU/Linux and on HP-UX 10 or higher.  Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc [built for 2.0n]
cc  +DA2.0 +e
@end example

Note that current versions of GCC (eg.@: 3.2) don't generate 64-bit
instructions for @code{long long} operations and so may be slower than for
2.0w.  (The GMP assembly code is the same though.)

@item @samp{ABI=1.0}
HPPA 2.0 CPUs can run all HPPA 1.0 and 1.1 code in the 32-bit HPPA 1.0 ABI@.
No special compiler options are needed for applications.
@end table

All three ABIs are available for CPU types @samp{hppa2.0w}, @samp{hppa2.0} and
@samp{hppa64}, but for CPU type @samp{hppa2.0n} only 2.0n or 1.0 are
considered.

Note that GCC on HP-UX has no options to choose between 2.0n and 2.0w modes,
unlike HP @command{cc}.  Instead it must be built for one or the other ABI@.
GMP will detect how it was built, and skip to the corresponding @samp{ABI}.

@cindex IA-64

HP-UX supports two ABIs for IA-64.  GMP performance is the same in both.

@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=32}
In the 32-bit ABI, pointers, @code{int}s and @code{long}s are 32 bits and GMP
uses a 64 bit @code{long long} for a limb.  Applications can be compiled
without any special flags since this ABI is the default in both HP C and GCC,
but for reference the flags are

@example
gcc  -milp32
cc   +DD32
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=64}
In the 64-bit ABI, @code{long}s and pointers are 64 bits and GMP uses a
@code{long} for a limb.  Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc  -mlp64
cc   +DD64
@end example
@end table

On other IA-64 systems, GNU/Linux for instance, @samp{ABI=64} is the only
choice.

@item MIPS under IRIX 6 (@samp{mips*-*-irix[6789]})
@cindex MIPS
@cindex IRIX
IRIX 6 always has a 64-bit MIPS 3 or better CPU, and supports ABIs o32, n32,
and 64.  n32 or 64 are recommended, and GMP performance will be the same in
each.  The default is n32.

@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=o32}
The o32 ABI is 32-bit pointers and integers, and no 64-bit operations.  GMP
will be slower than in n32 or 64, this option only exists to support old
compilers, eg.@: GCC 2.7.2.  Applications can be compiled with no special
flags on an old compiler, or on a newer compiler with

@example
gcc  -mabi=32
cc   -32
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=n32}
The n32 ABI is 32-bit pointers and integers, but with a 64-bit limb using a
@code{long long}.  Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc  -mabi=n32
cc   -n32
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=64}
The 64-bit ABI is 64-bit pointers and integers.  Applications must be compiled
with

@example
gcc  -mabi=64
cc   -64
@end example
@end table

Note that MIPS GNU/Linux, as of kernel version 2.2, doesn't have the necessary
support for n32 or 64 and so only gets a 32-bit limb and the MIPS 2 code.

@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=mode64}
@cindex AIX
The AIX 64 ABI uses 64-bit limbs and pointers and is the default on PowerPC 64
@samp{*-*-aix*} systems.  Applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc  -maix64
xlc  -q64
@end example

On 64-bit GNU/Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X/Darwin systems, the applications must
be compiled with

@example
gcc  -m64
@end example

@item @samp{ABI=mode32}
The @samp{mode32} ABI uses a 64-bit @code{long long} limb but with the chip
still in 32-bit mode and using 32-bit calling conventions.  This is the default
for systems where the true 64-bit ABI is unavailable.  No special compiler
options are typically needed for applications.  This ABI is not available under
AIX.

@item @samp{ABI=32}
This is the basic 32-bit PowerPC ABI, with a 32-bit limb.  No special compiler
options are needed for applications.
@end table

GMP's speed is greatest for the @samp{mode64} ABI, the @samp{mode32} ABI is 2nd
best.  In @samp{ABI=32} only the 32-bit ISA is used and this doesn't make full
use of a 64-bit chip.

@cindex Sparc V9
@cindex Solaris
@cindex Sun
@table @asis
@item @samp{ABI=64}
The 64-bit V9 ABI is available on the various BSD sparc64 ports, recent
versions of Sparc64 GNU/Linux, and Solaris 2.7 and up (when the kernel is in
64-bit mode).  GCC 3.2 or higher, or Sun @command{cc} is required.  On
GNU/Linux, depending on the default @command{gcc} mode, applications must be
compiled with

@example
gcc  -m64
@end example

On Solaris applications must be compiled with

@example
gcc  -m64 -mptr64 -Wa,-xarch=v9 -mcpu=v9
cc   -xarch=v9
@end example

On the BSD sparc64 systems no special options are required, since 64-bits is
the only ABI available.

@item @samp{ABI=32}
For the basic 32-bit ABI, GMP still uses as much of the V9 ISA as it can.  In
the Sun documentation this combination is known as ``v8plus''.  On GNU/Linux,
depending on the default @command{gcc} mode, applications may need to be
compiled with

@example
gcc  -m32
@end example

On Solaris, no special compiler options are required for applications, though
using something like the following is recommended.  (@command{gcc} 2.8 and
earlier only support @samp{-mv8} though.)

@example
gcc  -mv8plus
cc   -xarch=v8plus
@end example
@end table

GMP speed is greatest in @samp{ABI=64}, so it's the default where available.
The speed is partly because there are extra registers available and partly
because 64-bits is considered the more important case and has therefore had
better code written for it.

Don't be confused by the names of the @samp{-m} and @samp{-x} compiler
options, they're called @samp{arch} but effectively control both ABI and ISA@.

On Solaris 2.6 and earlier, only @samp{ABI=32} is available since the kernel
doesn't save all registers.

On Solaris 2.7 with the kernel in 32-bit mode, a normal native build will
reject @samp{ABI=64} because the resulting executables won't run.
@samp{ABI=64} can still be built if desired by making it look like a
cross-compile, for example

@example
./configure --build=none --host=sparcv9-sun-solaris2.7 ABI=64

@section Notes for Package Builds
@cindex Build notes for binary packaging
@cindex Packaged builds

GMP should present no great difficulties for packaging in a binary
distribution.

@cindex Libtool versioning
@cindex Shared library versioning
Libtool is used to build the library and @samp{-version-info} is set
appropriately, having started from @samp{3:0:0} in GMP 3.0 (@pxref{Versioning,
Library interface versions, Library interface versions, libtool, GNU
Libtool}).

The GMP 4 series will be upwardly binary compatible in each release and will
be upwardly binary compatible with all of the GMP 3 series.  Additional
function interfaces may be added in each release, so on systems where libtool
versioning is not fully checked by the loader an auxiliary mechanism may be
needed to express that a dynamic linked application depends on a new enough
GMP.

An auxiliary mechanism may also be needed to express that @file{libgmpxx.la}
(from @option{--enable-cxx}, @pxref{Build Options}) requires @file{libgmp.la}
from the same GMP version, since this is not done by the libtool versioning,
nor otherwise.  A mismatch will result in unresolved symbols from the linker,
or perhaps the loader.

When building a package for a CPU family, care should be taken to use
@samp{--host} (or @samp{--build}) to choose the least common denominator among
the CPUs which might use the package.  For example this might mean plain
@samp{sparc} (meaning V7) for SPARCs.

For x86s, @option{--enable-fat} sets things up for a fat binary build, making a
runtime selection of optimized low level routines.  This is a good choice for
packaging to run on a range of x86 chips.

Users who care about speed will want GMP built for their exact CPU type, to
make best use of the available optimizations.  Providing a way to suitably
rebuild a package may be useful.  This could be as simple as making it
possible for a user to omit @samp{--build} (and @samp{--host}) so
@samp{./config.guess} will detect the CPU@.  But a way to manually specify a
@samp{--build} will be wanted for systems where @samp{./config.guess} is
inexact.

On systems with multiple ABIs, a packaged build will need to decide which
among the choices is to be provided, see @ref{ABI and ISA}.  A given run of
@samp{./configure} etc will only build one ABI@.  If a second ABI is also
required then a second run of @samp{./configure} etc must be made, starting
from a clean directory tree (@samp{make distclean}).

As noted under ``ABI and ISA'', currently no attempt is made to follow system
conventions for install locations that vary with ABI, such as
@file{/usr/lib/sparcv9} for @samp{ABI=64} as opposed to @file{/usr/lib} for
@samp{ABI=32}.  A package build can override @samp{libdir} and other standard
variables as necessary.

Note that @file{gmp.h} is a generated file, and will be architecture and ABI
dependent.  When attempting to install two ABIs simultaneously it will be
important that an application compile gets the correct @file{gmp.h} for its
desired ABI@.  If compiler include paths don't vary with ABI options then it
might be necessary to create a @file{/usr/include/gmp.h} which tests
preprocessor symbols and chooses the correct actual @file{gmp.h}.

some versions of the native @command{ar} fail on the convenience libraries
used.  A shared build can be attempted with

@example

Note that the @samp{--disable-static} is necessary because in a shared build
libtool makes @file{libgmp.a} a symlink to @file{libgmp.so}, apparently for

all operations to be done in a particular precision, for instance single,
double or extended on x86 systems (x87 floating point).  The GMP functions
involving a @code{double} cannot be expected to operate to their full
precision when the hardware is in single precision mode.  Of course this
affects all code, including application code, not just GMP.

@item FreeBSD 7.x, 8.x, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
@cindex FreeBSD
@command{m4} in these releases of FreeBSD has an eval function which ignores
its 2nd and 3rd arguments, which makes it unsuitable for @file{.asm} file
processing.  @samp{./configure} will detect the problem and either abort or
choose another m4 in the @env{PATH}.  The bug is fixed in FreeBSD 9.3 and 10.0,
so either upgrade or use GNU m4.  Note that the FreeBSD package system installs
GNU m4 under the name @samp{gm4}, which GMP cannot guess.

@item FreeBSD 7.x, 8.x, 9.x
@cindex FreeBSD
GMP releases starting with 6.0 do not support @samp{ABI=32} on FreeBSD/amd64
prior to release 10.0 of the system.  The cause is a broken @code{limits.h},
which GMP no longer works around.

@item MS-DOS and MS Windows

@cindex MS Windows
@cindex Windows
@cindex Cygwin
@cindex DJGPP
@cindex MINGW
On an MS-DOS system DJGPP can be used to build GMP, and on an MS Windows
system Cygwin, DJGPP and MINGW can be used.  All three are excellent ports of
GCC and the various GNU tools.

@cindex Interix
@cindex Services for Unix
Microsoft also publishes an Interix ``Services for Unix'' which can be used to
build GMP on Windows (with a normal @samp{./configure}), but it's not free
software.

@item MS Windows DLLs
@cindex DLLs
@cindex MS Windows
@cindex Windows
On systems @samp{*-*-cygwin*}, @samp{*-*-mingw*} and @samp{*-*-pw32*} by
default GMP builds only a static library, but a DLL can be built instead using

@example
./configure --disable-static --enable-shared
@end example

Static and DLL libraries can't both be built, since certain export directives
in @file{gmp.h} must be different.

A MINGW DLL build of GMP can be used with Microsoft C@.  Libtool doesn't
install a @file{.lib} format import library, but it can be created with MS
@command{lib} as follows, and copied to the install directory.  Similarly for
@file{libmp} and @file{libgmpxx}.

@example
cd .libs
lib /def:libgmp-3.dll.def /out:libgmp-3.lib
@end example

MINGW uses the C runtime library @samp{msvcrt.dll} for I/O, so applications
wanting to use the GMP I/O routines must be compiled with @samp{cl /MD} to do
the same.  If one of the other C runtime library choices provided by MS C is
desired then the suggestion is to use the GMP string functions and confine I/O
to the application.

@item Motorola 68k CPU Types
@cindex 68000
@samp{m68k} is taken to mean 68000.  @samp{m68020} or higher will give a
performance boost on applicable CPUs.  @samp{m68360} can be used for CPU32
series chips.  @samp{m68302} can be used for ``Dragonball'' series chips,
though this is merely a synonym for @samp{m68000}.

@item NetBSD 5.x
@cindex NetBSD
@command{m4} in these releases of NetBSD has an eval function which ignores its
2nd and 3rd arguments, which makes it unsuitable for @file{.asm} file
processing.  @samp{./configure} will detect the problem and either abort or
choose another m4 in the @env{PATH}.  The bug is fixed in NetBSD 6, so either
upgrade or use GNU m4.  Note that the NetBSD package system installs GNU m4
under the name @samp{gm4}, which GMP cannot guess.

@item OpenBSD 2.6
@cindex OpenBSD
@command{m4} in this release of OpenBSD has a bug in @code{eval} that makes it
unsuitable for @file{.asm} file processing.  @samp{./configure} will detect
the problem and either abort or choose another m4 in the @env{PATH}.  The bug
is fixed in OpenBSD 2.7, so either upgrade or use GNU m4.

@item Power CPU Types
@cindex Power/PowerPC
In GMP, CPU types @samp{power*} and @samp{powerpc*} will each use instructions
not available on the other, so it's important to choose the right one for the
CPU that will be used.  Currently GMP has no assembly code support for using
just the common instruction subset.  To get executables that run on both, the
current suggestion is to use the generic C code (@option{--disable-assembly}),
possibly with appropriate compiler options (like @samp{-mcpu=common} for
@command{gcc}).  CPU @samp{rs6000} (which is not a CPU but a family of
workstations) is accepted by @file{config.sub}, but is currently equivalent to
@option{--disable-assembly}.

@item Sparc CPU Types
@cindex Sparc
@samp{sparcv8} or @samp{supersparc} on relevant systems will give a
significant performance increase over the V7 code selected by plain
@samp{sparc}.

@item Sparc App Regs
@cindex Sparc
The GMP assembly code for both 32-bit and 64-bit Sparc clobbers the
``application registers'' @code{g2}, @code{g3} and @code{g4}, the same way
that the GCC default @samp{-mapp-regs} does (@pxref{SPARC Options,, SPARC
Options, gcc, Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}).

This makes that code unsuitable for use with the special V9
@samp{-mcmodel=embmedany} (which uses @code{g4} as a data segment pointer), and
for applications wanting to use those registers for special purposes.  In these
cases the only suggestion currently is to build GMP with
@option{--disable-assembly} to avoid the assembly code.

@item SunOS 4
@cindex SunOS
@command{/usr/bin/m4} lacks various features needed to process @file{.asm}
files, and instead @samp{./configure} will automatically use
@command{/usr/5bin/m4}, which we believe is always available (if not then use
GNU m4).

@item x86 CPU Types
@cindex x86
@cindex 80x86
@cindex i386
@samp{i586}, @samp{pentium} or @samp{pentiummmx} code is good for its intended
P5 Pentium chips, but quite slow when run on Intel P6 class chips (PPro, P-II,
P-III)@.  @samp{i386} is a better choice when making binaries that must run on
both.

@item x86 MMX and SSE2 Code
@cindex MMX
@cindex SSE2
If the CPU selected has MMX code but the assembler doesn't support it, a
warning is given and non-MMX code is used instead.  This will be an inferior
build, since the MMX code that's present is there because it's faster than the
corresponding plain integer code.  The same applies to SSE2.

Old versions of @samp{gas} don't support MMX instructions, in particular
version 1.92.3 that comes with FreeBSD 2.2.8 or the more recent OpenBSD 3.1
doesn't.

Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 @command{as} generate incorrect object code for register
to register @code{movq} instructions, and so can't be used for MMX code.
Install a recent @command{gas} if MMX code is wanted on these systems.

You might find more up-to-date information at @uref{https://gmplib.org/}.

@table @asis
@item Compiler link options
The version of libtool currently in use rather aggressively strips compiler
options when linking a shared library.  This will hopefully be relaxed in the
future, but for now if this is a problem the suggestion is to create a little
script to hide them, and for instance configure with

@example
./configure CC=gcc-with-my-options
@end example

@item DJGPP (@samp{*-*-msdosdjgpp*})
@cindex DJGPP
The DJGPP port of @command{bash} 2.03 is unable to run the @samp{configure}
script, it exits silently, having died writing a preamble to
@file{config.log}.  Use @command{bash} 2.04 or higher.

@samp{make all} was found to run out of memory during the final
@file{libgmp.la} link on one system tested, despite having 64Mb available.
Running @samp{make libgmp.la} directly helped, perhaps recursing into the
various subdirectories uses up memory.

@item GNU binutils @command{strip} prior to 2.12
@cindex Stripped libraries
@cindex Binutils @command{strip}
@cindex GNU @command{strip}
@command{strip} from GNU binutils 2.11 and earlier should not be used on the
static libraries @file{libgmp.a} and @file{libmp.a} since it will discard all
but the last of multiple archive members with the same name, like the three
versions of @file{init.o} in @file{libgmp.a}.  Binutils 2.12 or higher can be
used successfully.

The shared libraries @file{libgmp.so} and @file{libmp.so} are not affected by
this and any version of @command{strip} can be used on them.

@item @command{make} syntax error
@cindex SCO
@cindex IRIX
On certain versions of SCO OpenServer 5 and IRIX 6.5 the native @command{make}
is unable to handle the long dependencies list for @file{libgmp.la}.  The
symptom is a ``syntax error'' on the following line of the top-level
@file{Makefile}.

@example
libgmp.la: $(libgmp_la_OBJECTS) $(libgmp_la_DEPENDENCIES)
@end example

Either use GNU Make, or as a workaround remove
@code{$(libgmp_la_DEPENDENCIES)} from that line (which will make the initial
build work, but if any recompiling is done @file{libgmp.la} might not be
rebuilt).

@item MacOS X (@samp{*-*-darwin*})
@cindex MacOS X
@cindex Darwin
Libtool currently only knows how to create shared libraries on MacOS X using
the native @command{cc} (which is a modified GCC), not a plain GCC@.  A
static-only build should work though (@samp{--disable-shared}).

@item NeXT prior to 3.3
@cindex NeXT
The system compiler on old versions of NeXT was a massacred and old GCC, even
if it called itself @file{cc}.  This compiler cannot be used to build GMP, you
need to get a real GCC, and install that.  (NeXT may have fixed this in
release 3.3 of their system.)

@item POWER and PowerPC
@cindex Power/PowerPC
Bugs in GCC 2.7.2 (and 2.6.3) mean it can't be used to compile GMP on POWER or
PowerPC@.  If you want to use GCC for these machines, get GCC 2.7.2.1 (or
later).

@item Sequent Symmetry
@cindex Sequent Symmetry
Use the GNU assembler instead of the system assembler, since the latter has
serious bugs.

@item Solaris 2.6
@cindex Solaris
The system @command{sed} prints an error ``Output line too long'' when libtool
builds @file{libgmp.la}.  This doesn't seem to cause any obvious ill effects,
but GNU @command{sed} is recommended, to avoid any doubt.

@item Sparc Solaris 2.7 with gcc 2.95.2 in @samp{ABI=32}
@cindex Solaris
A shared library build of GMP seems to fail in this combination, it builds but
then fails the tests, apparently due to some incorrect data relocations within
@code{gmp_randinit_lc_2exp_size}.  The exact cause is unknown,
@samp{--disable-shared} is recommended.

@node Performance optimization, , Known Build Problems, Installing GMP
@section Performance optimization
@cindex Optimizing performance

@c At some point, this should perhaps move to a separate chapter on optimizing
@c performance.

For optimal performance, build GMP for the exact CPU type of the target
computer, see @ref{Build Options}.

Unlike what is the case for most other programs, the compiler typically
doesn't matter much, since GMP uses assembly language for the most critical
operation.

In particular for long-running GMP applications, and applications demanding
extremely large numbers, building and running the @code{tuneup} program in the
@file{tune} subdirectory, can be important.  For example,

@example
cd tune
make tuneup
./tuneup
@end example

will generate better contents for the @file{gmp-mparam.h} parameter file.

To use the results, put the output in the file indicated in the
@samp{Parameters for ...} header.  Then recompile from scratch.

The @code{tuneup} program takes one useful parameter, @samp{-f NNN}, which
instructs the program how long to check FFT multiply parameters.  If you're
going to use GMP for extremely large numbers, you may want to run @code{tuneup}
with a large NNN value.

@cindex Headers

@cindex @file{gmp.h}
@cindex Include files
@cindex @code{#include}
All declarations needed to use GMP are collected in the include file
@file{gmp.h}.  It is designed to work with both C and C++ compilers.

@example
#include <gmp.h>
@end example

@cindex @code{stdio.h}
Note however that prototypes for GMP functions with @code{FILE *} parameters
are only provided if @code{<stdio.h>} is included too.

@example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gmp.h>
@end example

@cindex @code{stdarg.h}
Likewise @code{<stdarg.h>} is required for prototypes with @code{va_list}
parameters, such as @code{gmp_vprintf}.  And @code{<obstack.h>} for prototypes
with @code{struct obstack} parameters, such as @code{gmp_obstack_printf}, when
available.

@cindex Libraries
@cindex Linking
@cindex @code{libgmp}
All programs using GMP must link against the @file{libgmp} library.  On a
typical Unix-like system this can be done with @samp{-lgmp}, for example

@example
gcc myprogram.c -lgmp
@end example

@cindex @code{libgmpxx}
GMP C++ functions are in a separate @file{libgmpxx} library.  This is built
and installed if C++ support has been enabled (@pxref{Build Options}).  For
example,

@example
g++ mycxxprog.cc -lgmpxx -lgmp
@end example

@cindex Libtool
GMP is built using Libtool and an application can use that to link if desired,
@GMPpxreftop{libtool, GNU Libtool}.

If GMP has been installed to a non-standard location then it may be necessary
to use @samp{-I} and @samp{-L} compiler options to point to the right
directories, and some sort of run-time path for a shared library.


@node Nomenclature and Types, Function Classes, Headers and Libraries, GMP Basics
@section Nomenclature and Types
@cindex Nomenclature
@cindex Types

@cindex Integer
@tindex @code{mpz_t}
In this manual, @dfn{integer} usually means a multiple precision integer, as
defined by the GMP library.  The C data type for such integers is @code{mpz_t}.
Here are some examples of how to declare such integers:

@example
mpz_t sum;

struct foo @{ mpz_t x, y; @};

mpz_t vec[20];
@end example

@cindex Rational number
@tindex @code{mpq_t}
@dfn{Rational number} means a multiple precision fraction.  The C data type
for these fractions is @code{mpq_t}.  For example:

@example
mpq_t quotient;
@end example

@cindex Floating-point number
@tindex @code{mpf_t}
@dfn{Floating point number} or @dfn{Float} for short, is an arbitrary precision
mantissa with a limited precision exponent.  The C data type for such objects
is @code{mpf_t}.  For example:

@example
mpf_t fp;
@end example

@tindex @code{mp_exp_t}
The floating point functions accept and return exponents in the C type
@code{mp_exp_t}.  Currently this is usually a @code{long}, but on some systems
it's an @code{int} for efficiency.

@cindex Limb
@tindex @code{mp_limb_t}
A @dfn{limb} means the part of a multi-precision number that fits in a single
machine word.  (We chose this word because a limb of the human body is
analogous to a digit, only larger, and containing several digits.)  Normally a
limb is 32 or 64 bits.  The C data type for a limb is @code{mp_limb_t}.

@tindex @code{mp_size_t}
Counts of limbs of a multi-precision number represented in the C type
@code{mp_size_t}.  Currently this is normally a @code{long}, but on some
systems it's an @code{int} for efficiency, and on some systems it will be
@code{long long} in the future.

@tindex @code{mp_bitcnt_t}
Counts of bits of a multi-precision number are represented in the C type
@code{mp_bitcnt_t}.  Currently this is always an @code{unsigned long}, but on
some systems it will be an @code{unsigned long long} in the future.

@cindex Random state
@tindex @code{gmp_randstate_t}
@dfn{Random state} means an algorithm selection and current state data.  The C
data type for such objects is @code{gmp_randstate_t}.  For example:

@example
gmp_randstate_t rstate;
@end example

Also, in general @code{mp_bitcnt_t} is used for bit counts and ranges, and
@code{size_t} is used for byte or character counts.


@node Function Classes, Variable Conventions, Nomenclature and Types, GMP Basics
@section Function Classes
@cindex Function classes

There are six classes of functions in the GMP library:

@enumerate
@item
Functions for signed integer arithmetic, with names beginning with
@code{mpz_}.  The associated type is @code{mpz_t}.  There are about 150
functions in this class.  (@pxref{Integer Functions})

@item
Functions for rational number arithmetic, with names beginning with
@code{mpq_}.  The associated type is @code{mpq_t}.  There are about 35
functions in this class, but the integer functions can be used for arithmetic
on the numerator and denominator separately.  (@pxref{Rational Number
Functions})

@item
Functions for floating-point arithmetic, with names beginning with
@code{mpf_}.  The associated type is @code{mpf_t}.  There are about 70
functions is this class.  (@pxref{Floating-point Functions})

@item
Fast low-level functions that operate on natural numbers.  These are used by
the functions in the preceding groups, and you can also call them directly
from very time-critical user programs.  These functions' names begin with
@code{mpn_}.  The associated type is array of @code{mp_limb_t}.  There are
about 60 (hard-to-use) functions in this class.  (@pxref{Low-level Functions})

@item
Miscellaneous functions.  Functions for setting up custom allocation and
functions for generating random numbers.  (@pxref{Custom Allocation}, and
@pxref{Random Number Functions})
@end enumerate


@node Variable Conventions, Parameter Conventions, Function Classes, GMP Basics
@section Variable Conventions
@cindex Variable conventions
@cindex Conventions for variables

GMP functions generally have output arguments before input arguments.  This
notation is by analogy with the assignment operator.  The BSD MP compatibility
functions are exceptions, having the output arguments last.

GMP lets you use the same variable for both input and output in one call.  For
example, the main function for integer multiplication, @code{mpz_mul}, can be
used to square @code{x} and put the result back in @code{x} with

@example
mpz_mul (x, x, x);
@end example

Before you can assign to a GMP variable, you need to initialize it by calling
one of the special initialization functions.  When you're done with a
variable, you need to clear it out, using one of the functions for that
purpose.  Which function to use depends on the type of variable.  See the
chapters on integer functions, rational number functions, and floating-point
functions for details.

A variable should only be initialized once, or at least cleared between each
initialization.  After a variable has been initialized, it may be assigned to
any number of times.

For efficiency reasons, avoid excessive initializing and clearing.  In
general, initialize near the start of a function and clear near the end.  For
example,

@example
void
foo (void)
@{
  mpz_t  n;
  int    i;
  mpz_init (n);
  for (i = 1; i < 100; i++)
    @{
      mpz_mul (n, @dots{});
      mpz_fdiv_q (n, @dots{});
      @dots{}
    @}
  mpz_clear (n);
@}
@end example


@node Parameter Conventions, Memory Management, Variable Conventions, GMP Basics
@section Parameter Conventions
@cindex Parameter conventions
@cindex Conventions for parameters

When a GMP variable is used as a function parameter, it's effectively a
call-by-reference, meaning if the function stores a value there it will change
the original in the caller.  Parameters which are input-only can be designated
@code{const} to provoke a compiler error or warning on attempting to modify
them.

When a function is going to return a GMP result, it should designate a
parameter that it sets, like the library functions do.  More than one value
can be returned by having more than one output parameter, again like the
library functions.  A @code{return} of an @code{mpz_t} etc doesn't return the
object, only a pointer, and this is almost certainly not what's wanted.

Here's an example accepting an @code{mpz_t} parameter, doing a calculation,
and storing the result to the indicated parameter.

@example
void
foo (mpz_t result, const mpz_t param, unsigned long n)
@{
  unsigned long  i;
  mpz_mul_ui (result, param, n);
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
    mpz_add_ui (result, result, i*7);
@}

int
main (void)
@{
  mpz_t  r, n;
  mpz_init (r);
  mpz_init_set_str (n, "123456", 0);
  foo (r, n, 20L);
  gmp_printf ("%Zd\n", r);
  return 0;
@}
@end example

@code{foo} works even if the mainline passes the same variable for
@code{param} and @code{result}, just like the library functions.  But
sometimes it's tricky to make that work, and an application might not want to
bother supporting that sort of thing.

For interest, the GMP types @code{mpz_t} etc are implemented as one-element
arrays of certain structures.  This is why declaring a variable creates an
object with the fields GMP needs, but then using it as a parameter passes a
pointer to the object.  Note that the actual fields in each @code{mpz_t} etc
are for internal use only and should not be accessed directly by code that
expects to be compatible with future GMP releases.


@need 1000
@node Memory Management, Reentrancy, Parameter Conventions, GMP Basics
@section Memory Management
@cindex Memory management

The GMP types like @code{mpz_t} are small, containing only a couple of sizes,
and pointers to allocated data.  Once a variable is initialized, GMP takes
care of all space allocation.  Additional space is allocated whenever a
variable doesn't have enough.

@code{mpz_t} and @code{mpq_t} variables never reduce their allocated space.
Normally this is the best policy, since it avoids frequent reallocation.
Applications that need to return memory to the heap at some particular point
can use @code{mpz_realloc2}, or clear variables no longer needed.

@code{mpf_t} variables, in the current implementation, use a fixed amount of
space, determined by the chosen precision and allocated at initialization, so
their size doesn't change.

All memory is allocated using @code{malloc} and friends by default, but this
can be changed, see @ref{Custom Allocation}.  Temporary memory on the stack is
also used (via @code{alloca}), but this can be changed at build-time if
desired, see @ref{Build Options}.


@node Reentrancy, Useful Macros and Constants, Memory Management, GMP Basics
@section Reentrancy
@cindex Reentrancy
@cindex Thread safety
@cindex Multi-threading

@noindent
GMP is reentrant and thread-safe, with some exceptions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If configured with @option{--enable-alloca=malloc-notreentrant} (or with
@option{--enable-alloca=notreentrant} when @code{alloca} is not available),
then naturally GMP is not reentrant.

@item
@code{mpf_set_default_prec} and @code{mpf_init} use a global variable for the
selected precision.  @code{mpf_init2} can be used instead, and in the C++
interface an explicit precision to the @code{mpf_class} constructor.

@item
@code{mpz_random} and the other old random number functions use a global
random state and are hence not reentrant.  The newer random number functions
that accept a @code{gmp_randstate_t} parameter can be used instead.

@item
@code{gmp_randinit} (obsolete) returns an error indication through a global
variable, which is not thread safe.  Applications are advised to use
@code{gmp_randinit_default} or @code{gmp_randinit_lc_2exp} instead.

@item
@code{mp_set_memory_functions} uses global variables to store the selected
memory allocation functions.

@item
If the memory allocation functions set by a call to
@code{mp_set_memory_functions} (or @code{malloc} and friends by default) are
not reentrant, then GMP will not be reentrant either.

@item
If the standard I/O functions such as @code{fwrite} are not reentrant then the
GMP I/O functions using them will not be reentrant either.

@item
It's safe for two threads to read from the same GMP variable simultaneously,
but it's not safe for one to read while another might be writing, nor for
two threads to write simultaneously.  It's not safe for two threads to
generate a random number from the same @code{gmp_randstate_t} simultaneously,
since this involves an update of that variable.

with other @code{mpn} functions.

@item
@code{mpf_get_prec} counted precision slightly differently in GMP 3.0 and
3.0.1, but in 3.1 reverted to the 2.x style.

@item
@code{mpn_bdivmod}, documented as preliminary in GMP 4, has been removed.
@end itemize

There are a number of compatibility issues between GMP 1 and GMP 2 that of
course also apply when porting applications from GMP 1 to GMP 5.  Please
see the GMP 2 manual for details.

@c @item Integer division functions round the result differently.  The obsolete
@c functions (@code{mpz_div}, @code{mpz_divmod}, @code{mpz_mdiv},
@c @code{mpz_mdivmod}, etc) now all use floor rounding (i.e., they round the
@c quotient towards
@c @ifinfo
@c @minus{}infinity).
@c @end ifinfo
@c @iftex
@c @tex
@c $-\infty$).
@c @end tex
@c @end iftex
@c There are a lot of functions for integer division, giving the user better
@c control over the rounding.

@c @item The function @code{mpz_mod} now compute the true @strong{mod} function.

@c @item The functions @code{mpz_powm} and @code{mpz_powm_ui} now use
@c @strong{mod} for reduction.

@c @item The assignment functions for rational numbers do no longer canonicalize
@c their results.  In the case a non-canonical result could arise from an
@c assignment, the user need to insert an explicit call to
@c @code{mpq_canonicalize}.  This change was made for efficiency.

@c @item Output generated by @code{mpz_out_raw} in this release cannot be read
@c by @code{mpz_inp_raw} in previous releases.  This change was made for making
@c the file format truly portable between machines with different word sizes.

@c @item Several @code{mpn} functions have changed.  But they were intentionally
@c undocumented in previous releases.

@c @item The functions @code{mpz_cmp_ui}, @code{mpz_cmp_si}, and @code{mpq_cmp_ui}
@c are now implemented as macros, and thereby sometimes evaluate their
@c arguments multiple times.

@c @item The functions @code{mpz_pow_ui} and @code{mpz_ui_pow_ui} now yield 1
@c for 0^0.  (In version 1, they yielded 0.)

@c In version 1 of the library, @code{mpq_set_den} handled negative
@c denominators by copying the sign to the numerator.  That is no longer done.

@c Pure assignment functions do not canonicalize the assigned variable.  It is
@c the responsibility of the user to canonicalize the assigned variable before
@c any arithmetic operations are performed on that variable.
@c Note that this is an incompatible change from version 1 of the library.

As an aside, consideration has been given at various times to some sort of
expression evaluation within the main GMP library.  Going beyond something
minimal quickly leads to matters like user-defined functions, looping, fixnums
for control variables, etc, which are considered outside the scope of GMP

@node Efficiency, Debugging, Demonstration Programs, GMP Basics
@section Efficiency
@cindex Efficiency

@table @asis
@item Small Operands
@cindex Small operands
On small operands, the time for function call overheads and memory allocation
can be significant in comparison to actual calculation.  This is unavoidable
in a general purpose variable precision library, although GMP attempts to be
as efficient as it can on both large and small operands.

@item Static Linking
@cindex Static linking
On some CPUs, in particular the x86s, the static @file{libgmp.a} should be
used for maximum speed, since the PIC code in the shared @file{libgmp.so} will
have a small overhead on each function call and global data address.  For many
programs this will be insignificant, but for long calculations there's a gain
to be had.

@item Initializing and Clearing
@cindex Initializing and clearing
Avoid excessive initializing and clearing of variables, since this can be
quite time consuming, especially in comparison to otherwise fast operations
like addition.

A language interpreter might want to keep a free list or stack of
initialized variables ready for use.  It should be possible to integrate
something like that with a garbage collector too.

@item Reallocations
@cindex Reallocations
An @code{mpz_t} or @code{mpq_t} variable used to hold successively increasing
values will have its memory repeatedly @code{realloc}ed, which could be quite
slow or could fragment memory, depending on the C library.  If an application
can estimate the final size then @code{mpz_init2} or @code{mpz_realloc2} can
be called to allocate the necessary space from the beginning
(@pxref{Initializing Integers}).

It doesn't matter if a size set with @code{mpz_init2} or @code{mpz_realloc2}
is too small, since all functions will do a further reallocation if necessary.
Badly overestimating memory required will waste space though.

@item @code{2exp} Functions
@cindex @code{2exp} functions
It's up to an application to call functions like @code{mpz_mul_2exp} when
appropriate.  General purpose functions like @code{mpz_mul} make no attempt to
identify powers of two or other special forms, because such inputs will
usually be very rare and testing every time would be wasteful.

@item @code{ui} and @code{si} Functions
@cindex @code{ui} and @code{si} functions
The @code{ui} functions and the small number of @code{si} functions exist for
convenience and should be used where applicable.  But if for example an
@code{mpz_t} contains a value that fits in an @code{unsigned long} there's no
need extract it and call a @code{ui} function, just use the regular @code{mpz}
function.

@item In-Place Operations
@cindex In-place operations
@code{mpz_abs}, @code{mpq_abs}, @code{mpf_abs}, @code{mpz_neg}, @code{mpq_neg}
and @code{mpf_neg} are fast when used for in-place operations like
@code{mpz_abs(x,x)}, since in the current implementation only a single field
of @code{x} needs changing.  On suitable compilers (GCC for instance) this is
inlined too.

@code{mpz_add_ui}, @code{mpz_sub_ui}, @code{mpf_add_ui} and @code{mpf_sub_ui}
benefit from an in-place operation like @code{mpz_add_ui(x,x,y)}, since
usually only one or two limbs of @code{x} will need to be changed.  The same
applies to the full precision @code{mpz_add} etc if @code{y} is small.  If
@code{y} is big then cache locality may be helped, but that's all.

@code{mpz_mul} is currently the opposite, a separate destination is slightly
better.  A call like @code{mpz_mul(x,x,y)} will, unless @code{y} is only one
limb, make a temporary copy of @code{x} before forming the result.  Normally
that copying will only be a tiny fraction of the time for the multiply, so
this is not a particularly important consideration.

@code{mpz_set}, @code{mpq_set}, @code{mpq_set_num}, @code{mpf_set}, etc, make
no attempt to recognise a copy of something to itself, so a call like
@code{mpz_set(x,x)} will be wasteful.  Naturally that would never be written
deliberately, but if it might arise from two pointers to the same object then
a test to avoid it might be desirable.

@example
if (x != y)
  mpz_set (x, y);
@end example

Note that it's never worth introducing extra @code{mpz_set} calls just to get
in-place operations.  If a result should go to a particular variable then just
direct it there and let GMP take care of data movement.

@item Divisibility Testing (Small Integers)
@cindex Divisibility testing
@code{mpz_divisible_ui_p} and @code{mpz_congruent_ui_p} are the best functions
for testing whether an @code{mpz_t} is divisible by an individual small
integer.  They use an algorithm which is faster than @code{mpz_tdiv_ui}, but
which gives no useful information about the actual remainder, only whether
it's zero (or a particular value).

However when testing divisibility by several small integers, it's best to take
a remainder modulo their product, to save multi-precision operations.  For
instance to test whether a number is divisible by any of 23, 29 or 31 take a
remainder modulo @math{23@times{}29@times{}31 = 20677} and then test that.

The division functions like @code{mpz_tdiv_q_ui} which give a quotient as well
as a remainder are generally a little slower than the remainder-only functions
like @code{mpz_tdiv_ui}.  If the quotient is only rarely wanted then it's
probably best to just take a remainder and then go back and calculate the
quotient if and when it's wanted (@code{mpz_divexact_ui} can be used if the
remainder is zero).

@item Rational Arithmetic
@cindex Rational arithmetic
The @code{mpq} functions operate on @code{mpq_t} values with no common factors
in the numerator and denominator.  Common factors are checked-for and cast out
as necessary.  In general, cancelling factors every time is the best approach
since it minimizes the sizes for subsequent operations.

However, applications that know something about the factorization of the
values they're working with might be able to avoid some of the GCDs used for
canonicalization, or swap them for divisions.  For example when multiplying by
a prime it's enough to check for factors of it in the denominator instead of
doing a full GCD@.  Or when forming a big product it might be known that very
little cancellation will be possible, and so canonicalization can be left to
the end.

The @code{mpq_numref} and @code{mpq_denref} macros give access to the
numerator and denominator to do things outside the scope of the supplied
@code{mpq} functions.  @xref{Applying Integer Functions}.

The canonical form for rationals allows mixed-type @code{mpq_t} and integer
additions or subtractions to be done directly with multiples of the
denominator.  This will be somewhat faster than @code{mpq_add}.  For example,

@example
/* mpq increment */
mpz_add (mpq_numref(q), mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q));

/* mpq += unsigned long */
mpz_addmul_ui (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), 123UL);

/* mpq -= mpz */
mpz_submul (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), z);
@end example

@item Number Sequences
@cindex Number sequences
Functions like @code{mpz_fac_ui}, @code{mpz_fib_ui} and @code{mpz_bin_uiui}
are designed for calculating isolated values.  If a range of values is wanted
it's probably best to call to get a starting point and iterate from there.

@item Text Input/Output
@cindex Text input/output
Hexadecimal or octal are suggested for input or output in text form.
Power-of-2 bases like these can be converted much more efficiently than other
bases, like decimal.  For big numbers there's usually nothing of particular
interest to be seen in the digits, so the base doesn't matter much.

Maybe we can hope octal will one day become the normal base for everyday use,
as proposed by King Charles XII of Sweden and later reformers.

@cindex Debugging

@table @asis
@item Stack Overflow
@cindex Stack overflow
@cindex Segmentation violation
@cindex Bus error
Depending on the system, a segmentation violation or bus error might be the
only indication of stack overflow.  See @samp{--enable-alloca} choices in
@ref{Build Options}, for how to address this.

In new enough versions of GCC, @samp{-fstack-check} may be able to ensure an
overflow is recognised by the system before too much damage is done, or
@samp{-fstack-limit-symbol} or @samp{-fstack-limit-register} may be able to
add checking if the system itself doesn't do any (@pxref{Code Gen Options,,
Options for Code Generation, gcc, Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}).
These options must be added to the @samp{CFLAGS} used in the GMP build
(@pxref{Build Options}), adding them just to an application will have no
effect.  Note also they're a slowdown, adding overhead to each function call
and each stack allocation.

@item Heap Problems
@cindex Heap problems
@cindex Malloc problems
The most likely cause of application problems with GMP is heap corruption.
Failing to @code{init} GMP variables will have unpredictable effects, and
corruption arising elsewhere in a program may well affect GMP@.  Initializing
GMP variables more than once or failing to clear them will cause memory leaks.

@cindex Malloc debugger
In all such cases a @code{malloc} debugger is recommended.  On a GNU or BSD
system the standard C library @code{malloc} has some diagnostic facilities,
see @ref{Allocation Debugging,, Allocation Debugging, libc, The GNU C Library
Reference Manual}, or @samp{man 3 malloc}.  Other possibilities, in no
particular order, include

@display
@uref{http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/biere/projects/ccmalloc/}
@uref{http://dmalloc.com/}
@uref{http://www.perens.com/FreeSoftware/} @ (electric fence)
@uref{http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/fda}
@uref{http://www.gnupdate.org/components/leakbug/}
@uref{http://people.redhat.com/~otaylor/memprof/}
@uref{http://www.cbmamiga.demon.co.uk/mpatrol/}
@end display

The GMP default allocation routines in @file{memory.c} also have a simple
sentinel scheme which can be enabled with @code{#define DEBUG} in that file.
This is mainly designed for detecting buffer overruns during GMP development,
but might find other uses.

@item Stack Backtraces
@cindex Stack backtrace
On some systems the compiler options GMP uses by default can interfere with
debugging.  In particular on x86 and 68k systems @samp{-fomit-frame-pointer}
is used and this generally inhibits stack backtracing.  Recompiling without
such options may help while debugging, though the usual caveats about it
potentially moving a memory problem or hiding a compiler bug will apply.

@item GDB, the GNU Debugger
@cindex GDB
@cindex GNU Debugger
A sample @file{.gdbinit} is included in the distribution, showing how to call
some undocumented dump functions to print GMP variables from within GDB@.  Note
that these functions shouldn't be used in final application code since they're
undocumented and may be subject to incompatible changes in future versions of
GMP.

@item Source File Paths
GMP has multiple source files with the same name, in different directories.
For example @file{mpz}, @file{mpq} and @file{mpf} each have an
@file{init.c}.  If the debugger can't already determine the right one it may
help to build with absolute paths on each C file.  One way to do that is to
use a separate object directory with an absolute path to the source directory.

@example
cd /my/build/dir
/my/source/dir/gmp-@value{VERSION}/configure
@end example

This works via @code{VPATH}, and might require GNU @command{make}.
Alternately it might be possible to change the @code{.c.lo} rules
appropriately.

@item Assertion Checking
@cindex Assertion checking
The build option @option{--enable-assert} is available to add some consistency
checks to the library (see @ref{Build Options}).  These are likely to be of
limited value to most applications.  Assertion failures are just as likely to
indicate memory corruption as a library or compiler bug.

Applications using the low-level @code{mpn} functions, however, will benefit
from @option{--enable-assert} since it adds checks on the parameters of most
such functions, many of which have subtle restrictions on their usage.  Note
however that only the generic C code has checks, not the assembly code, so
@option{--disable-assembly} should be used for maximum checking.

@item Temporary Memory Checking
The build option @option{--enable-alloca=debug} arranges that each block of
temporary memory in GMP is allocated with a separate call to @code{malloc} (or
the allocation function set with @code{mp_set_memory_functions}).

This can help a malloc debugger detect accesses outside the intended bounds,
or detect memory not released.  In a normal build, on the other hand,
temporary memory is allocated in blocks which GMP divides up for its own use,
or may be allocated with a compiler builtin @code{alloca} which will go
nowhere near any malloc debugger hooks.

@item Maximum Debuggability
To summarize the above, a GMP build for maximum debuggability would be

@example
./configure --disable-shared --enable-assert \
  --enable-alloca=debug --disable-assembly CFLAGS=-g
@end example

For C++, add @samp{--enable-cxx CXXFLAGS=-g}.

@item Checker
@cindex Checker
@cindex GCC Checker
The GCC checker (@uref{https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/checker/}) can be
used with GMP@.  It contains a stub library which means GMP applications
compiled with checker can use a normal GMP build.

A build of GMP with checking within GMP itself can be made.  This will run
very very slowly.  On GNU/Linux for example,

@cindex @command{checkergcc}
@example
./configure --disable-assembly CC=checkergcc
@end example

@option{--disable-assembly} must be used, since the GMP assembly code doesn't
support the checking scheme.  The GMP C++ features cannot be used, since
current versions of checker (0.9.9.1) don't yet support the standard C++
library.

@item Valgrind
@cindex Valgrind
Valgrind (@uref{http://valgrind.org/}) is a memory checker for x86, ARM, MIPS,
PowerPC, and S/390.  It translates and emulates machine instructions to do
strong checks for uninitialized data (at the level of individual bits), memory
accesses through bad pointers, and memory leaks.

Valgrind does not always support every possible instruction, in particular
ones recently added to an ISA.  Valgrind might therefore be incompatible with
a recent GMP or even a less recent GMP which is compiled using a recent GCC.

GMP's assembly code sometimes promotes a read of the limbs to some larger size,
for efficiency.  GMP will do this even at the start and end of a multilimb
operand, using naturally aligned operations on the larger type.  This may lead
to benign reads outside of allocated areas, triggering complaints from
Valgrind.  Valgrind's option @samp{--partial-loads-ok=yes} should help.

@item Other Problems
Any suspected bug in GMP itself should be isolated to make sure it's not an
application problem, see @ref{Reporting Bugs}.
@end table


@node Profiling, Autoconf, Debugging, GMP Basics
@section Profiling
@cindex Profiling
@cindex Execution profiling
@cindex @code{--enable-profiling}

Running a program under a profiler is a good way to find where it's spending
most time and where improvements can be best sought.  The profiling choices
for a GMP build are as follows.

@table @asis
@item @samp{--disable-profiling}
The default is to add nothing special for profiling.

It should be possible to just compile the mainline of a program with @code{-p}
and use @command{prof} to get a profile consisting of timer-based sampling of
the program counter.  Most of the GMP assembly code has the necessary symbol
information.

This approach has the advantage of minimizing interference with normal program
operation, but on most systems the resolution of the sampling is quite low (10
milliseconds for instance), requiring long runs to get accurate information.

@item @samp{--enable-profiling=prof}
@cindex @code{prof}
Build with support for the system @command{prof}, which means @samp{-p} added
to the @samp{CFLAGS}.

This provides call counting in addition to program counter sampling, which
allows the most frequently called routines to be identified, and an average
time spent in each routine to be determined.

The x86 assembly code has support for this option, but on other processors
the assembly routines will be as if compiled without @samp{-p} and therefore
won't appear in the call counts.

On some systems, such as GNU/Linux, @samp{-p} in fact means @samp{-pg} and in
this case @samp{--enable-profiling=gprof} described below should be used
instead.

@item @samp{--enable-profiling=gprof}
@cindex @code{gprof}
Build with support for @command{gprof}, which means @samp{-pg} added to the
@samp{CFLAGS}.

This provides call graph construction in addition to call counting and program
counter sampling, which makes it possible to count calls coming from different
locations.  For example the number of calls to @code{mpn_mul} from
@code{mpz_mul} versus the number from @code{mpf_mul}.  The program counter
sampling is still flat though, so only a total time in @code{mpn_mul} would be
accumulated, not a separate amount for each call site.

The x86 assembly code has support for this option, but on other processors
the assembly routines will be as if compiled without @samp{-pg} and therefore
not be included in the call counts.

On x86 and m68k systems @samp{-pg} and @samp{-fomit-frame-pointer} are
incompatible, so the latter is omitted from the default flags in that case,
which might result in poorer code generation.

Incidentally, it should be possible to use the @command{gprof} program with a
plain @samp{--enable-profiling=prof} build.  But in that case only the
@samp{gprof -p} flat profile and call counts can be expected to be valid, not
the @samp{gprof -q} call graph.

@item @samp{--enable-profiling=instrument}
@cindex @code{-finstrument-functions}
@cindex @code{instrument-functions}
Build with the GCC option @samp{-finstrument-functions} added to the
@samp{CFLAGS} (@pxref{Code Gen Options,, Options for Code Generation, gcc,
Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}).

This inserts special instrumenting calls at the start and end of each
function, allowing exact timing and full call graph construction.

This instrumenting is not normally a standard system feature and will require
support from an external library, such as

@cindex FunctionCheck
@cindex fnccheck
@display
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnccheck/}
@end display

This should be included in @samp{LIBS} during the GMP configure so that test
programs will link.  For example,

@example
./configure --enable-profiling=instrument LIBS=-lfc
@end example

On a GNU system the C library provides dummy instrumenting functions, so
programs compiled with this option will link.  In this case it's only
necessary to ensure the correct library is added when linking an application.

The x86 assembly code supports this option, but on other processors the
assembly routines will be as if compiled without
@samp{-finstrument-functions} meaning time spent in them will effectively be
attributed to their caller.
@end table


@node Autoconf, Emacs, Profiling, GMP Basics
@section Autoconf
@cindex Autoconf

Autoconf based applications can easily check whether GMP is installed.  The
only thing to be noted is that GMP library symbols from version 3 onwards have
prefixes like @code{__gmpz}.  The following therefore would be a simple test,

@cindex @code{AC_CHECK_LIB}
@example
AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init)
@end example

This just uses the default @code{AC_CHECK_LIB} actions for found or not found,
but an application that must have GMP would want to generate an error if not
found.  For example,

@example
AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_init, ,
  [AC_MSG_ERROR([GNU MP not found, see https://gmplib.org/])])
@end example

If functions added in some particular version of GMP are required, then one of
those can be used when checking.  For example @code{mpz_mul_si} was added in
GMP 3.1,

@example
AC_CHECK_LIB(gmp, __gmpz_mul_si, ,
  [AC_MSG_ERROR(
  [GNU MP not found, or not 3.1 or up, see https://gmplib.org/])])
@end example

An alternative would be to test the version number in @file{gmp.h} using say
@code{AC_EGREP_CPP}.  That would make it possible to test the exact version,
if some particular sub-minor release is known to be necessary.

In general it's recommended that applications should simply demand a new
enough GMP rather than trying to provide supplements for features not
available in past versions.

Occasionally an application will need or want to know the size of a type at
configuration or preprocessing time, not just with @code{sizeof} in the code.
This can be done in the normal way with @code{mp_limb_t} etc, but GMP 4.0 or
up is best for this, since prior versions needed certain @samp{-D} defines on
systems using a @code{long long} limb.  The following would suit Autoconf 2.50
or up,

@example
AC_CHECK_SIZEOF(mp_limb_t, , [#include <gmp.h>])
@end example

@key{C-h C-i} (@code{info-lookup-symbol}) is a good way to find documentation
on C functions while editing (@pxref{Info Lookup, , Info Documentation Lookup,

The GMP manual can be included in such lookups by putting the following in
your @file{.emacs},

@c  This isn't pretty, but there doesn't seem to be a better way (in emacs
@c  21.2 at least).  info-lookup->mode-value could be used for the "assoc"s,

Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with something
definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or piecemeal messages
are difficult to act on and don't help the development effort.

It is not uncommon that an observed problem is actually due to a bug in the
compiler; the GMP code tends to explore interesting corners in compilers.

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you get a corrected
version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we won't do anything about
it (except maybe ask you to send a better report).

Send your report to: @email{gmp-bugs@@gmplib.org}.

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if
the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.

@chapter Integer Functions
@cindex Integer functions

This chapter describes the GMP functions for performing integer arithmetic.
These functions start with the prefix @code{mpz_}.

GMP integers are stored in objects of type @code{mpz_t}.

@section Initialization Functions
@cindex Integer initialization functions
@cindex Initialization functions

The functions for integer arithmetic assume that all integer objects are
initialized.  You do that by calling the function @code{mpz_init}.  For
example,

@example
@{
  mpz_t integ;
  mpz_init (integ);
  @dots{}
  mpz_add (integ, @dots{});
  @dots{}
  mpz_sub (integ, @dots{});

  /* Unless the program is about to exit, do ... */
  mpz_clear (integ);
@}
@end example

As you can see, you can store new values any number of times, once an
object is initialized.

@deftypefun void mpz_init (mpz_t @var{x})
Initialize @var{x}, and set its value to 0.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_inits (mpz_t @var{x}, ...)
Initialize a NULL-terminated list of @code{mpz_t} variables, and set their
values to 0.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_init2 (mpz_t @var{x}, mp_bitcnt_t @var{n})
Initialize @var{x}, with space for @var{n}-bit numbers, and set its value to 0.
Calling this function instead of @code{mpz_init} or @code{mpz_inits} is never
necessary; reallocation is handled automatically by GMP when needed.

While @var{n} defines the initial space, @var{x} will grow automatically in the
normal way, if necessary, for subsequent values stored.  @code{mpz_init2} makes
it possible to avoid such reallocations if a maximum size is known in advance.

In preparation for an operation, GMP often allocates one limb more than
ultimately needed.  To make sure GMP will not perform reallocation for
@var{x}, you need to add the number of bits in @code{mp_limb_t} to @var{n}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_clear (mpz_t @var{x})
Free the space occupied by @var{x}.  Call this function for all @code{mpz_t}
variables when you are done with them.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_clears (mpz_t @var{x}, ...)
Free the space occupied by a NULL-terminated list of @code{mpz_t} variables.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_realloc2 (mpz_t @var{x}, mp_bitcnt_t @var{n})
Change the space allocated for @var{x} to @var{n} bits.  The value in @var{x}
is preserved if it fits, or is set to 0 if not.

Calling this function is never necessary; reallocation is handled automatically
by GMP when needed.  But this function can be used to increase the space for a
variable in order to avoid repeated automatic reallocations, or to decrease it
to give memory back to the heap.

These functions assign new values to already initialized integers
(@pxref{Initializing Integers}).

@deftypefun void mpz_set (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{op})
@deftypefunx void mpz_set_ui (mpz_t @var{rop}, unsigned long int @var{op})
@deftypefunx void mpz_set_si (mpz_t @var{rop}, signed long int @var{op})

@deftypefunx void mpz_set_f (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpf_t @var{op})
Set the value of @var{rop} from @var{op}.

@code{mpz_set_d}, @code{mpz_set_q} and @code{mpz_set_f} truncate @var{op} to
make it an integer.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpz_set_str (mpz_t @var{rop}, const char *@var{str}, int @var{base})
Set the value of @var{rop} from @var{str}, a null-terminated C string in base
@var{base}.  White space is allowed in the string, and is simply ignored.

The @var{base} may vary from 2 to 62, or if @var{base} is 0, then the leading
characters are used: @code{0x} and @code{0X} for hexadecimal, @code{0b} and
@code{0B} for binary, @code{0} for octal, or decimal otherwise.

For bases up to 36, case is ignored; upper-case and lower-case letters have
the same value.  For bases 37 to 62, upper-case letter represent the usual
10..35 while lower-case letter represent 36..61.

This function returns 0 if the entire string is a valid number in base
@var{base}.  Otherwise it returns @minus{}1.
@c
@c  It turns out that it is not entirely true that this function ignores
@c  white-space.  It does ignore it between digits, but not after a minus sign
@c  or within or after ``0x''.  Some thought was given to disallowing all
@c  whitespace, but that would be an incompatible change, whitespace has been
@c  documented as ignored ever since GMP 1.
@c
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_swap (mpz_t @var{rop1}, mpz_t @var{rop2})
Swap the values @var{rop1} and @var{rop2} efficiently.
@end deftypefun

For convenience, GMP provides a parallel series of initialize-and-set functions
which initialize the output and then store the value there.  These functions'
names have the form @code{mpz_init_set@dots{}}

Here is an example of using one:

@example
@{
  mpz_t pie;
  mpz_init_set_str (pie, "3141592653589793238462643383279502884", 10);
  @dots{}
  mpz_sub (pie, @dots{});
  @dots{}
  mpz_clear (pie);
@}
@end example

@noindent
Once the integer has been initialized by any of the @code{mpz_init_set@dots{}}
functions, it can be used as the source or destination operand for the ordinary
integer functions.  Don't use an initialize-and-set function on a variable
already initialized!

@deftypefun void mpz_init_set (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{op})
@deftypefunx void mpz_init_set_ui (mpz_t @var{rop}, unsigned long int @var{op})
@deftypefunx void mpz_init_set_si (mpz_t @var{rop}, signed long int @var{op})
@deftypefunx void mpz_init_set_d (mpz_t @var{rop}, double @var{op})
Initialize @var{rop} with limb space and set the initial numeric value from
@var{op}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun int mpz_init_set_str (mpz_t @var{rop}, const char *@var{str}, int @var{base})
Initialize @var{rop} and set its value like @code{mpz_set_str} (see its
documentation above for details).

If the string is a correct base @var{base} number, the function returns 0;
if an error occurs it returns @minus{}1.  @var{rop} is initialized even if
an error occurs.  (I.e., you have to call @code{mpz_clear} for it.)

@section Conversion Functions
@cindex Integer conversion functions
@cindex Conversion functions

This section describes functions for converting GMP integers to standard C
types.  Functions for converting @emph{to} GMP integers are described in
@ref{Assigning Integers} and @ref{I/O of Integers}.

@deftypefun {unsigned long int} mpz_get_ui (const mpz_t @var{op})
Return the value of @var{op} as an @code{unsigned long}.

If @var{op} is too big to fit an @code{unsigned long} then just the least
significant bits that do fit are returned.  The sign of @var{op} is ignored,
only the absolute value is used.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {signed long int} mpz_get_si (const mpz_t @var{op})
If @var{op} fits into a @code{signed long int} return the value of @var{op}.
Otherwise return the least significant part of @var{op}, with the same sign
as @var{op}.

If @var{op} is too big to fit in a @code{signed long int}, the returned
result is probably not very useful.  To find out if the value will fit, use
the function @code{mpz_fits_slong_p}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun double mpz_get_d (const mpz_t @var{op})
Convert @var{op} to a @code{double}, truncating if necessary (i.e.@: rounding
towards zero).

If the exponent from the conversion is too big, the result is system
dependent.  An infinity is returned where available.  A hardware overflow trap
may or may not occur.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun double mpz_get_d_2exp (signed long int *@var{exp}, const mpz_t @var{op})
Convert @var{op} to a @code{double}, truncating if necessary (i.e.@: rounding
towards zero), and returning the exponent separately.

The return value is in the range @math{0.5@le{}@GMPabs{@var{d}}<1} and the
exponent is stored to @code{*@var{exp}}.  @m{@var{d} * 2^{exp}, @var{d} *
2^@var{exp}} is the (truncated) @var{op} value.  If @var{op} is zero, the
return is @math{0.0} and 0 is stored to @code{*@var{exp}}.

@cindex @code{frexp}
This is similar to the standard C @code{frexp} function (@pxref{Normalization
Functions,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {char *} mpz_get_str (char *@var{str}, int @var{base}, const mpz_t @var{op})
Convert @var{op} to a string of digits in base @var{base}.  The base argument
may vary from 2 to 62 or from @minus{}2 to @minus{}36.

For @var{base} in the range 2..36, digits and lower-case letters are used; for
@minus{}2..@minus{}36, digits and upper-case letters are used; for 37..62,
digits, upper-case letters, and lower-case letters (in that significance order)
are used.

If @var{str} is @code{NULL}, the result string is allocated using the current
allocation function (@pxref{Custom Allocation}).  The block will be
@code{strlen(str)+1} bytes, that being exactly enough for the string and
null-terminator.

If @var{str} is not @code{NULL}, it should point to a block of storage large
enough for the result, that being @code{mpz_sizeinbase (@var{op}, @var{base})
+ 2}.  The two extra bytes are for a possible minus sign, and the
null-terminator.

A pointer to the result string is returned, being either the allocated block,
or the given @var{str}.

Division is undefined if the divisor is zero.  Passing a zero divisor to the
division or modulo functions (including the modular powering functions

zero.  This lets a program handle arithmetic exceptions in these functions the
same way as for normal C @code{int} arithmetic.

@cindex Bit shift right

@sp 1
Divide @var{n} by @var{d}, forming a quotient @var{q} and/or remainder
@var{r}.  For the @code{2exp} functions, @m{@var{d}=2^b, @var{d}=2^@var{b}}.
The rounding is in three styles, each suiting different applications.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{cdiv} rounds @var{q} up towards @m{+\infty, +infinity}, and @var{r} will
have the opposite sign to @var{d}.  The @code{c} stands for ``ceil''.

@item
@code{fdiv} rounds @var{q} down towards @m{-\infty, @minus{}infinity}, and
@var{r} will have the same sign as @var{d}.  The @code{f} stands for
``floor''.

@item
@code{tdiv} rounds @var{q} towards zero, and @var{r} will have the same sign
as @var{n}.  The @code{t} stands for ``truncate''.
@end itemize

In all cases @var{q} and @var{r} will satisfy
@m{@var{n}=@var{q}@var{d}+@var{r}, @var{n}=@var{q}*@var{d}+@var{r}}, and
@var{r} will satisfy @math{0@le{}@GMPabs{@var{r}}<@GMPabs{@var{d}}}.

The @code{q} functions calculate only the quotient, the @code{r} functions
only the remainder, and the @code{qr} functions calculate both.  Note that for
@code{qr} the same variable cannot be passed for both @var{q} and @var{r}, or
results will be unpredictable.

For the @code{ui} variants the return value is the remainder, and in fact
returning the remainder is all the @code{div_ui} functions do.  For
@code{tdiv} and @code{cdiv} the remainder can be negative, so for those the
return value is the absolute value of the remainder.

For the @code{2exp} variants the divisor is @m{2^b,2^@var{b}}.  These
functions are implemented as right shifts and bit masks, but of course they
round the same as the other functions.

For positive @var{n} both @code{mpz_fdiv_q_2exp} and @code{mpz_tdiv_q_2exp}
are simple bitwise right shifts.  For negative @var{n}, @code{mpz_fdiv_q_2exp}
is effectively an arithmetic right shift treating @var{n} as twos complement
the same as the bitwise logical functions do, whereas @code{mpz_tdiv_q_2exp}
effectively treats @var{n} as sign and magnitude.

Set @var{r} to @var{n} @code{mod} @var{d}.  The sign of the divisor is
ignored; the result is always non-negative.

@code{mpz_mod_ui} is identical to @code{mpz_fdiv_r_ui} above, returning the
remainder as well as setting @var{r}.  See @code{mpz_fdiv_ui} above if only
the return value is wanted.

@deftypefunx void mpz_powm_ui (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{base}, unsigned long int @var{exp}, const mpz_t @var{mod})
Set @var{rop} to @m{base^{exp} \bmod mod, (@var{base} raised to @var{exp})
modulo @var{mod}}.

Negative @var{exp} is supported if an inverse @math{@var{base}^@W{-1} @bmod
@var{mod}} exists (see @code{mpz_invert} in @ref{Number Theoretic Functions}).
If an inverse doesn't exist then a divide by zero is raised.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_powm_sec (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{base}, const mpz_t @var{exp}, const mpz_t @var{mod})
Set @var{rop} to @m{base^{exp} \bmod @var{mod}, (@var{base} raised to @var{exp})
modulo @var{mod}}.

It is required that @math{@var{exp} > 0} and that @var{mod} is odd.

This function is designed to take the same time and have the same cache access
patterns for any two same-size arguments, assuming that function arguments are
placed at the same position and that the machine state is identical upon
function entry.  This function is intended for cryptographic purposes, where
resilience to side-channel attacks is desired.

@deftypefunx void mpz_ui_pow_ui (mpz_t @var{rop}, unsigned long int @var{base}, unsigned long int @var{exp})
Set @var{rop} to @m{base^{exp}, @var{base} raised to @var{exp}}.  The case
@math{0^0} yields 1.

@deftypefun int mpz_root (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{op}, unsigned long int @var{n})
Set @var{rop} to @m{\lfloor\root n \of {op}\rfloor@C{},} the truncated integer
part of the @var{n}th root of @var{op}.  Return non-zero if the computation
was exact, i.e., if @var{op} is @var{rop} to the @var{n}th power.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_rootrem (mpz_t @var{root}, mpz_t @var{rem}, const mpz_t @var{u}, unsigned long int @var{n})
Set @var{root} to @m{\lfloor\root n \of {u}\rfloor@C{},} the truncated
integer part of the @var{n}th root of @var{u}.  Set @var{rem} to the
remainder, @m{(@var{u} - @var{root}^n),
@var{u}@minus{}@var{root}**@var{n}}.

@deftypefun void mpz_sqrt (mpz_t @var{rop}, const mpz_t @var{op})
Set @var{rop} to @m{\lfloor\sqrt{@var{op}}\rfloor@C{},} the truncated
integer part of the square root of @var{op}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun void mpz_sqrtrem (mpz_t @var{rop1}, mpz_t @var{rop2}, const mpz_t @var{op})
Set @var{rop1} to @m{\lfloor\sqrt{@var{op}}\rfloor, the truncated integer part
of the square root of @var{op}}, like @code{mpz_sqrt}.  Set @var{rop2} to the
remainder @m{(@var{op} - @var{rop1}^2),
@var{op}@minus{}@var{rop1}*@var{rop1}}, which will be zero if @var{op} is a
perfect square.

If @var{rop1} and @var{rop2} are the same variable, the results are
undefined.

@deftypefun int mpz_perfect_power_p (const mpz_t @var{op})
@cindex Perfect power functions
@cindex Root testing functions
Return non-zero if @var{op} is a perfect power, i.e., if there exist integers
@m{a,@var{a}} and @m{b,@var{b}}, with @m{b>1, @var{b}>1}, such that
@m{@var{op}=a^b, @var{op} equals @var{a} raised to the power @var{b}}.

Under this definition both 0 and 1 are considered to be perfect powers.
Negative values of @var{op} are accepted, but of course can only be odd
perfect powers.

@cindex Root testing functions
Return non-zero if @var{op} is a perfect square, i.e., if the square root of
@var{op} is an integer.  Under this definition both 0 and 1 are considered to
be perfect squares.
